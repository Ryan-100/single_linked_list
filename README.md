# single_linked_list
I am learning linked list in C programming language.
You can run each file running the command ``` gcc -o [name.exe] [file.c]```.
Then, you will see the ```name.exe``` file in your current folder structure.
You can simply just run ```./name``` in your terminal.
I wrote these code from referencing Neso Academy.
There are some changes I do with the code to understand the concepts and for future relearning.


# Why we use linked list over arrays ?
## Arrays are hard to define size and memory overflow in some cases.
## Linked Lists do not require defining the size. We just have to allcate the memory when creating a list.
## There are some cases the time complexity of Linked List is better than arrays.
## Even though logics are complex, they are really useful for handling the tons of data.
